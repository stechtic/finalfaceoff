    <p id="p1">The day of farewell approaches as Cambrian League reaches its concluding chapter with the announcement of its last and final event - "Final Faceoff".

From Doutre's late dramatic win over Jodha to Edward's humiliating 6-0 victory over Mainwaring, the League witnessed epic combacks, brilliant plays, Individual masterclass and above all, the true sportsmanship shown by each player on the pitch.

Here is a recap of the events which made the league "special", earning a place in our hearts forever:

Starting from Season 1, with Abhinav scoring the first ever goal of the opening match, Jodha City F.C. thrashed Edward F.C., making their place in the finals.On the other hand, the football world marvelled over the intense match between Mainwaring United and Doutre F.C., the final scoreline being Mainwaring Utd. 2 - 1 Doutre. Goals from Mainwaring side were scored by the young forward duo- Prashant and Shivam, whereas Akshar managed to net the ball in the last minutes of the play, saving his club from an embarrassing defeat.

The finale, played between Mainwaring United and Jodha City  F.C., embodied the true essence of the league.The match commenced with Akshar opening the scoreline followed by Prashant's solo goal, sealing off the 2-nil victory over the blues. With this, Mainwaring United won the first ever phase of the Cambrian League.

The football community was not ready for what awaited them in Season 2 of the Cambrian League. The season started with Jodha flooring Doutre with a 2-1 victory, as Prashant scored the winning two goals for the blues while  Pratyush netting one for Doutre. The next match, played between Edward F.C. and Mainwaring United, the prior champions, was the greatest highlight of the season. The match concluded with a compelling 6-nil victory for Edwards, with Prashant and Pratyush both scoring individual hattricks, owning the Red devils and marching into the finals. 

Edward F.C. knocked down Jodha City F.C. with a convincing 3-1 victory in the finals, establishing them as the champions of the second season.(Final match s2: Goal scorers from Edward's side- Pratyush(2), Prashant(1); Goal scorer from Jodha City's side- Akshar)

 The thrilling third season of the Cambrian League started with Edward F.C. defeating Mainwaring Utd. by 3-2 (Goal scorers from Edward's side-Abhay, Prashant, Pratyush; Goal scorers from Mainwaring's side-Akshar, Shivam),  while Doutre F.C. overthrew Jodha City F.C. with the score of 2-1 (Goal scorers from Doutre's side- Pratyush, Shourya ; Goal scorer from Jodha City's side- Shivam). 

The remarkable final match of the season left the football world in awe and astonishment. Edward F.C., the expected winners, saw themselves shattered by individual hattricks of Anjal and Shivam from Doutre F.C.'s side, somewhat recreating Edward's double hattrick victory over Mainwaring Utd. back in season 2. The yellows tried to level the score as Abhinav, Prashant and later Pratyush bagged a total of 3 goals for the team.
